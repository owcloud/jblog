I am a constellation of holes;
hungry, 
bottomless pit that can fit anything.
Satiety mocks at me,
bewildered at our unfamiliarity.

I have a swollen belly full of fire, impregnated with 
disappointment which burns my insides and
I melt through my eyes.
The acidity of hope cuts wounds through which
regret oozes out, rancid and raw,
immature and unaware of its source.
Hope has taken a benign form, tumored in a 
corner, unmoving, and stagnant
while despondency spreads malignantly in me.

My limbs weigh a little heavier each day
and dragging my unenthusiastic body around has 
become a chore that I am failing miserably at, 
as if I am being slowly poisoned.
Each sunrise adds a hint of death,
decaying my body a bit more every day.
And suddenly, in an urgency, out of nowhere
I ask, "what am I?" instead of "who am I?"
and, "what am I becoming?"

I am a shadow walking behind a failed plan,
a ghost at the periphery, in unlooked corners,
a walking bleeding wound but invisible.
I am an endless repetition of dream, eat, and shit,
a cycle of predicted steps and practiced phrases
to be chanted over dinner, "How was your day,"
"Of course I am okay."

From a thousand years away this life had beamed at me,
like a sparkling glass slipper sitting at the window 
of an uptown shop beyond my league.
But now as I walk on swollen feet in them, its clatter
unsettling across the floor, the constant fear of shattering them
make each step mindful like walking in cuffs.
They've lost their allure.

My entire life is sprawled across the floor
in bits and pieces of glittering mess - sparkling happy and
reflecting tears of sorrow - 
a pile of the lived parts and another of the remaining
unlived portions demanding to be rushed over with, 
as if the determination with which they gleam
is from the knowledge of its eventual fate of fading away.

I search for peace in silence,
in abandoned rooms and in deficiency of people,
in advice of wise friends and in experimental herbs,
I sink in emptiness.
Nothingness is supposed to bring content
but it has brought relentless echoes instead, of
unspoken thoughts, grief, and desires.

And when the silence starts biting at the edges of my
sanity, I run off to the crowd of reassuring faces
and misplaced names, stay in arms of the man 
I love but do not recognize, and coop myself under
familiarity, under false words pouring off of soft lips
that glisten from pause-less sips of venomous wine.
It is not sadness that I am running away from,
it is the lack of happiness.

Sometimes I get confused if I am running towards 
something or away from it, 
all I recognize is the desperation to run.

I am a tug of war between an overflow of emotions
and of being emotionally stunted.
I am conflicted if I have given up on feeling
or if I have just started,
conflicted if I have already lost myself or
just starting to scratch the surface of 
my meaning.
