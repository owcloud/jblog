It’s quiet in here.

Am I in my mind, in a closed room? Chained? Prisoned? In a dream perhaps? 
Or is this another world, an afterlife? Dark, black, blinding. 
Are my eyes closed? Am I blind? Do I even have eyes? Is sight a possibility here?
I wake up from a sleep I do not remember falling into, and everything is new, unrecognizable.
Who was I before I slept? Who have I woken up as?
If I have skin I cannot feel the air, or the temperature of this space I am suspended into. I cannot possibly be sitting, or standing, or lying down because I do not feel a surface. I do not feel anything. 

I remember the structure of the body I used to have, I remember owning a shoulder,  so I concentrate. Focus all my attention to the weak girdle that held my arms. “Move it”, I tell myself, “try to move your arm”. But nothing stirs. As if I am a heavy paralyzed piece of log cursed against motion. Can I move my fingertips? My toes? Wiggle my nose? Shed a tear? 

I can’t feel anything. Is this how death is supposed to be. Or the afterlife? To travel from a world of overflowing emotions, clutter, noise, overwhelming air, overwhelming everything to a realm of nothing. No sound, no air, no touch, no sight. Nothing. Is this what peace is supposed to be? Vacuum? 

Can I never see a face again. Can I never hold my man again. Can I never feel the rain against my skin again. Can I never sip coffee again. Can I never feel my cats purr against me again. Can I never smell my mother’s embrace again.

Is this why the memories of a past life snatched away at our births. To free us from expectation? From pre-conceived desires that might never be found here? Am I in another amnios again? Am I being reborn? Am I ready to start everything from scratch again?

But then jolt of searing pain awakens my body, a pointed tip of a hollow syringe that purges consciousness into me. I am aware. Of my body, of the air around my body, of the vibrations in the air around my body from the infinitesimal footsteps, lip movements, things banging on other things. I am awake. And as the anesthesia slowly wears off and I can see and recognize faces again, I know exactly what face I wish to be looking at for the rest of my days in this form of existence.
