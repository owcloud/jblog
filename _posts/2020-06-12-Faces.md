And then you gave me faces,

So many of them.


And you gave me the technique

To hide each under one.


This maturity has again begun to sprout,

As it chases me merciless, my eyes cloud.

I suffocate in my cocoon, curled and wet,

Weak, helpless and ugly, yet another face.


This is the mature me,

Struggling in the world.

Bound by its rules, 

Curses and colors.


I do, too, have beautiful shades,

Let me flaunt them, please.

But the world is only entertained,

To look at the ugly side of me.


I can pray and I can love.

Trust me, I can be trusted.

These hideous scars are mere evidences

Of the world savoring my beauty.


Let me free and I shall teach you freedom,

Pity to me a chance, and I shall embrace myself.

I have a pretty face too, it well hides the scars,

A happy heart that could make you laugh,

A pretty shade that could be enchanting,

A bright side if you could discover me full.
