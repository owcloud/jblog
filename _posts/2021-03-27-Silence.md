<p>I will keep my mouth shut, just this one more time</p>
<p>I remind myself again tonight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the words that I save the world from</p>
<p>bite at me</p>
<p>from within, they spill off the bowls I thought</p>
<p>I had them contained in,</p>
<p>scratch at the doors of the room I thought</p>
<p>they were locked in -</p>
<p>their screeching nails, the dampness on the floor</p>
<p>itches me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To avoid starting a war with the world</p>
<p>I start one within myself</p>
<p>day after day, silence after silence,</p>
<p>I am a brimming cup</p>
<p>testing how deep I can dig within to</p>
<p>bury</p>
<p>everything I have ever felt.</p>
