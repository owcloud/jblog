I tiptoe around you, 
calculated touches, careful hugs because
you are a ball of electricity covered in skin - 
dangerous, life-threatening, destructive;
so there's certainty to the extent
until which we can stretch, and I always end up
stretching a bit further and the fear of snapping
is real, infuriating, tempting;
but I am careful, like you, I am contained
and I don't let myself spill even when I am 
saturated, consumed, lost; I contain.

We tread carefully in raging waves of desire,
knowledge of passion for each other, in each other.

No it cannot happen because *fill another reason here,
convincing myself against you every day,
exhausted, tired of the slipping control over
the steering of my own heart.

And years pass, in tiptoe-ing,
ignoring, swaying, regaining, losing.
Lovers come, lovers go and a lifetime washes away
in denying what we have innately known
and every single time I look in your eyes
I see 
it's always been you, of course
its always been you.
