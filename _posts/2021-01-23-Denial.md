<p style="text-align: center;">I tiptoe around you, <br />calculated touches, careful hugs because<br />you are a ball of electricity covered in skin - <br />dangerous, life-threatening, destructive;<br />so there's certainty to the extent<br />until which we can stretch, and I always end up<br />stretching a bit further and the fear of snapping<br />is real, infuriating, tempting;<br />but I am careful, like you, I am contained<br />and I don't let myself spill even when I am <br />saturated, consumed, lost; I contain.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">We tread carefully in raging waves of desire,<br />knowledge of passion for each other, in each other.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">No it cannot happen because *fill another reason here,<br />convincing myself against you every day,<br />exhausted, tired of the slipping control over<br />the steering of my own heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And years pass, in tiptoe-ing,<br />ignoring, swaying, regaining, losing.<br />Lovers come, lovers go and a lifetime washes away<br />in denying what we have innately known<br />and every single time I look in your eyes<br />I see <br />it's always been you, of course<br />its always been you.</p>
