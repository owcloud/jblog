<p style="text-align: center;">I am at the backseat of our car which runs at a moderate speed,<br />just at the speed-limit. We aren't rushing yet the landscape out of my window<br />passes and disappears in a haze. I haven't had enough time to<br />make out the lines of the buildings we run by, no time to<br />look at the branches, smell the flowers, recognize the breed of the<br />farm we keep driving through. No time. Everything is an urgency,<br />everyone in a hurry, and I am lost inside my head unaware of when<br />we ever even passed three towns. We are here, the driver says,<br />let's get refreshments before we start again.<br />And for a moment I am confused as to where we are even driving to.<br />I know that I had the destination well etched in my mind<br />before I had hopped into the backseat of this car, but I do not remember anymore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I do not remember where we left off from, or when we even started travelling.<br />Has it been a day, a week, months? Ages?<br />Going around, looping cities but not looking at them,<br />not feeling them, not living in them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am lost inside my head once again but he says that the world out there<br />is much more than it is in my head, and for a moment I am relieved;<br />because if it wasn't, what was the point anyway?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">And I know he isn't bluffing because I have seen how cruel the world<br />can be, and such imagination is beyond me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I am happy, when was the last time I was happy?<br />It is blurry, and the definitions of everything I have learnt so far are<br />changing. Evolving.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I thought I understood love, the conditions to it.<br />But as we travel through towns after towns,<br />pass ages after ages, the most absolute beliefs and ideas<br />that I had stood in conviction for are metamorphosing too.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I thought I understood love, its predicaments, its rewards,<br />but I am not sure anymore. Maybe it is in my head too.<br />Maybe I need to open my eyes, get outside my head, step off this car,<br />live in one of these unnamed cities, touch the trees we keep passing by,<br />smell the delicious flowers, feel the graveled roads,<br />maybe then I could be sure.</p>
