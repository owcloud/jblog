I am at the backseat of our car which runs at a moderate speed,
just at the speed-limit. We aren't rushing yet the landscape out of my window
passes and disappears in a haze. I haven't had enough time to
make out the lines of the buildings we run by, no time to
look at the branches, smell the flowers, recognize the breed of the
farm we keep driving through. No time. Everything is an urgency,
everyone in a hurry, and I am lost inside my head unaware of when
we ever even passed three towns. We are here, the driver says,
let's get refreshments before we start again.
And for a moment I am confused as to where we are even driving to.
I know that I had the destination well etched in my mind
before I had hopped into the backseat of this car, but I do not remember anymore.

I do not remember where we left off from, or when we even started travelling.
Has it been a day, a week, months? Ages?
Going around, looping cities but not looking at them,
not feeling them, not living in them.

I am lost inside my head once again but he says that the world out there
is much more than it is in my head, and for a moment I am relieved;
because if it wasn't, what was the point anyway?

And I know he isn't bluffing because I have seen how cruel the world
can be, and such imagination is beyond me.

I am happy, when was the last time I was happy?
It is blurry, and the definitions of everything I have learnt so far are
changing. Evolving.

I thought I understood love, the conditions to it.
But as we travel through towns after towns,
pass ages after ages, the most absolute beliefs and ideas
that I had stood in conviction for are metamorphosing too.

I thought I understood love, its predicaments, its rewards,
but I am not sure anymore. Maybe it is in my head too.
Maybe I need to open my eyes, get outside my head, step off this car,
live in one of these unnamed cities, touch the trees we keep passing by,
smell the delicious flowers, feel the graveled roads,
maybe then I could be sure.
