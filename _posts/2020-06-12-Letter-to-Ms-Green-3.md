Dear Ms Green,

How are you doing?

I am writing today to talk of Kevin, did I ever mention him to you. 
He is a new transferee from the most celebrated school of the city. On the first day of our second year, I was thirty minutes early to class, as usual. And normally I am the first person to class, and sit and wait for others to show up, but on this day when I entered, there was this unfamiliar perfectly carved breathing piece of human art sitting in the front row gazing at his phone. His eyes met mine as I moved to my usual spot at the last row of the classroom, and I could swear Ms Green if I had been attached to an ECG machine at that moment, I swear you could have seen me skip a heartbeat, or maybe several. He was so hot, Ms Green, so fucking hot.

Now I am sure he wasn’t in our class because I know all my classmates from first year, so maybe he was in the wrong classroom, or perhaps a transferee, I wasn’t sure at this point but I am not the one to start a conversation so obviously I kept all these questions in my head. Him though, he smiled at me, and after I had sat down, he walked to me, and said “Hey, are you a second year too?” OH MY SWEET FUCKING LORD! His voice was as perfect as his body, and if any of the five senses in my body hadn’t been enamoured with him until this point, they sure were now. Wait, not my skin though, maybe he would offer a handshake? But he didn’t. So just the four other senses then, all full of him. Now I know what you must be thinking, but don’t. I love Heath, of course, with all of my true heart. But can’t we take a minute to appreciate beauty and let it do to you what it’s meant to do to minds? It’s just a crush, Ms Green, a very tempting hot melting chocolate that you would want to dip in kind of crush.

It has been four months since I laid my eyes on him for the first time, and beside the two lines of conversation we had on the first day of school, we haven’t really talked. We do sometimes “Hi” each other. I don’t want to ruin my crush on him by trying to getting to know him because I know how disappointing reality can be. And from a distance he looks and feels almost perfect, and I wish for him to stay this way.

Its been four months Ms Green, and I havent thought of anyone else but him while I touch myself. Heath doesn’t like it when I do that; he often asks me to let him be near me when I touch myself, sometimes he would ask me if he could just watch, but it’s such a personal moment, he doesn’t understand. Sometimes it’s okay to have him near, but honestly, I don’t like it. 

Infidelity is such a strong temptation, and the idea of it arouses me so much. Heath was concerned when I told him this, and I used to think that maybe it was the same for everyone, maybe the excitement of doing something that we weren’t supposed to be doing is a shared excitement among all of us, I strongly used to feel that. But Heath doesn’t, and when I told him about these feelings, he was concerned as if I might actually do something like that to him. But in a decade of our relationship he knows me better. He knows of things I am capable of, and adultery isn’t me. But for my sake, he does sometimes, although with utmost reluctance, agrees to infidel role-plays with me; very occasionally. Such a strong emotion – cheating. Cheating on your partner. I cannot count the number of times I have reached orgasm thinking about cheating on Heath. And for the past four months it’s all been about Kevin. 

I love getting off Kevin, because the best part about him is that I do not know him, so in my head he is whatever I want him to be. He is gentle when I want him to be gentle, and he is rough when I want him to be wild. He says the exact words I wish for him to say at the exact moment I wish for him to say them. I have always loved reading erotica rather than watch porn, the act itself doesn’t arouse me as much as the build up does. I do not need to watch or read about what and how does an intercourse happen, I know that very well, thank you. But the situations and the story leading two people to the point where they would actually fuck, that gets me so wet. And words, Ms Green, they are the ultimate seduction, they have always been. Ernest Hemmingway, Li-Young Lee, Eliot, Sylvia Plath, Alina Pleskova - oh my sweet strawberry motherfucking Lord. Said words, written words, words when read – all forms of it, there’s no bigger arousal than whispering the right words to me, I guess. 

“_The menace of the abyss will be subdued, I say,
When I extort from you the most lovely cries
And quivering whispered pleas
And confused appeals of, Stop, and, More, and Harder.”_
- "The Undressing", Li-Young Lee

A mouth that can talk like that, a mind that can make such noises, such mouth shouldn’t stay devoid of sores that only a kiss can bring. And in my head, in bed when it’s dark and there are no disturbances, intense words from unreal mouths of imaginary lovers guide me to bliss. 

“_But true lovers know, she says, hunger vacant of love is a confusion._”


There’s nothing that I enjoy more than this moment of privacy, in a pretend world where I can say whatever I want to say and hear whatever it is that I want to hear, and get exactly what I want to get for myself. These small moments to myself, I wouldn’t trade them for anything. Nothing in my existence has felt more intense than how I can make myself feel, except for Heath’s tongue, of course, that’s  a complete different level of ecstasy that cannot pawned for anything,ever.

Regards,
M
