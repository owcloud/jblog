A little square hole stays covered with
a thick blue rug - opaque that doesnâ€™t pity the light,
doesn't let anything through, unless ruggedly pulled away.

This hole - that could vaguely be recognized as a window
if you look hard enough,
if you look from a certain angle - 
shows a singular tree whose leaves hang low under the weight of the dust,
a tree that isn't green
or perhaps the greenness is hidden somewhere beneath the 
coat of dirt - my world's snow 
that covers every surface that your eyes may touch.

There used to be a time when my heart too could
move to the music, to the sound of the leaves brushing against each other,
to the tapping of the raindrops against 
these brutally blanketed surfaces,
a time when my heart didn't seem to possess weight,
a time when I was unaware of it's existence because 
it was painless.

But now, just as the hopeless skeleton of an apparent tree
prays for the rain to wash off the pollution of 
the unnatural drought,
I too weep hoping my tears could in someway
wash away the heavy dirt that has permanently 
settled over my heart.
