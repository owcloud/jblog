<p style="text-align: center;">A little square hole stays covered with<br />a thick blue rug - opaque that doesn&rsquo;t pity the light,<br />doesn't let anything through, unless ruggedly pulled away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">This hole - that could vaguely be recognized as a window<br />if you look hard enough,<br />if you look from a certain angle - <br />shows a singular tree whose leaves hang low under the weight of the dust,<br />a tree that isn't green<br />or perhaps the greenness is hidden somewhere beneath the <br />coat of dirt - my world's snow <br />that covers every surface that your eyes may touch.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">There used to be a time when my heart too could<br />move to the music, to the sound of the leaves brushing against each other,<br />to the tapping of the raindrops against <br />these brutally blanketed surfaces,<br />a time when my heart didn't seem to possess weight,<br />a time when I was unaware of it's existence because <br />it was painless.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">But now, just as the hopeless skeleton of an apparent tree<br />prays for the rain to wash off the pollution of <br />the unnatural drought,<br />I too weep hoping my tears could in someway<br />wash away the heavy dirt that has permanently <br />settled over my heart.</p>
