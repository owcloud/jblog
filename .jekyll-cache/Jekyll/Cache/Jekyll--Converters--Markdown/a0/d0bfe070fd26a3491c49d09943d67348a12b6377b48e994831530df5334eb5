<p><br />
This book is a collection of a few poems I wrote when I was in school.
Iâ€™ve talked about â€œLoveâ€, â€œLonelinessâ€, and â€œRealityâ€ in the book â€“ the most common emotions and questions a young mind of a girl in her adolescence usually wander about. It talks about teenage crushes, first loves, heart breaks, identifying with the female gender in the society, its perks and disadvantages, and several other things.
<br />
â€œSome folded papers
Lost in shelves, as is me,
Among shiny slippers, silver plates,
Among belaud words I donâ€™t mean.â€
<br />
