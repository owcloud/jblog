<p>Iâ€™m Jaya Mishra.</p>

<p><br />
I was born in a small city in India, and moved to the Philippines seven years ago. I am a post graduate intern in Medicine, and wish to take up residency in Pediatrics soon.</p>

<p><br />
I have always been a curious child, inquisitive, and perhaps borderline-annoying with my â€œtoo manyâ€ questions about everything. I started writing when I was eight years old, and my first poem was actually a song that I had cooked, primarily to irritate my sister with its goofy lyrics. My sister, though, instead of screaming or telling on me, said â€œthat actually sounds very poetic.â€ And everything that I wrote after that, the most foolish of things, she has been a constant supporter and my most loyal audience.</p>

<p><br />
I have been writing ever since then.</p>

<p><br />
Poetry, for me, is more of a cure than art; one that cures all kinds of ailments of the soul â€“ loneliness, doubts, love, loss, and everything else. It, undoubtedly, is the most beautiful form of human art â€“ expression through language; a language that can elegantly inculcate all other forms of art â€“ imagery, music, rhythm.</p>

<p><br />
Although with the lifestyle I have chosen in the field of Medicine, it becomes difficult at times to go back to writing. But the need to pen down my thoughts and the joy that a finished piece brings, it has me going back to it again and again.</p>

<p><br />
My first book of poetry, <strong>â€œHer Green Diaryâ€</strong> was published in 2016. It contains a few handpicked poems that I had penned down in my diary for several years. If you enjoy reading poems, you can check it out<a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.in/Her-Green-Diary-Jaya-Mishra-ebook/dp/B01M0ABC35"> here</a>.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>â€œLetters to Ms Greenâ€</strong> is a thread of posts that I have recently started. Ms Green is my green diary that I often, if not every day, talk to. Sometimes there are thoughts or incidents that are difficult to talk about, mainly because of the fear of being judged or the stigma some topics bring. But the head doesnâ€™t simply cease to think only because the society has shunned it to be a â€œtaboo.â€ I am a mental health advocate, being inside and part of the medical community, I have seen and experienced how difficult <strong>â€œnot being able to talkâ€</strong> about something can be.</p>

<p><br />
If you have comments on anything that youâ€™ve read here (both positive and negative), something that you would want to share, or simply somebody that you wish to talk to, you can always write to me at mail@jayamishra.com</p>

Thank you for being here.</p>

Regards,
<br />
Greenie</p>

<strong>PS</strong>: If you get easily offended by â€œwomen who speakâ€ or â€œwomen talking of things they SHOULDNâ€™T be talking aboutâ€, I humbly notify you that this definitely is not a place you SHOULD be lurking about.</p>
