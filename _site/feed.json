            "content_text": "Dear Ms Green,\n\nHave you ever thought of killing yourself?\n\nAh, I am sorry, I forgot, you can’t really die since you’re not living. Don’t be disheartened Ms Green, life isn’t such a great thing to have anyway, so I can assure you that you’re not missing out on much.\n\nI came across Kurt Cobain’s suicide letter, and was in awe of how simple it was. It made me think of what I might write if ever I had to write one, some day. The last words, wouldn’t you want it to be beautiful or impactful maybe? Rather than simple things that you say every day. But then again, beauty is in simplicity, isn’t it? And when he talks about Freddie, it made think, did he ever even meet Freddie, he must have. But truly though, how much did he know him anyway. To say that he cannot feel what Mercury had felt, and how could he know what Mercury had felt? What if he was faking it too, just like him. My point is, how can you be so certain of what the other person is feeling, and act on it, want it, be envious it?\n\nI look at other people my age, more successful, happier, looking like they have it all figured out and life is such a fun ride. Maybe for some of them it is. But how true is it, and how real? Maybe for some other people, my life might appear that way. But what do they know? Oh, what do they really know, Ms Green.\n\nLife is pain in the ass Ms Green, the problems aren’t as discouraging as the quest to figure it out is; to figure out the purpose of my life I mean. Perhaps if we knew, if I knew, what I was here for and where I am going and what I am doing and the decisions I am making based on what I think I should be doing – is it all even going in the direction I was supposed to be going, or am I making a one-eighty run and am not even aware of it. And it’s scary sometimes, especially because of the religion I was born into, although I do not believe in it but the idea does cross my head sometimes. They say that if things didn’t go right, I would have to born again to correct the mistakes I made in this life. And how foolish is that, like what kind of foolish mission are you sending me to if you won’t even let me know what my mission is in the first place, and then punish me for making mistakes too?\n\nIt looks tempting from the outside Ms Green, the idea of being able to feel, and to love, to be satisfied. And one might be interested or excited even at the thought of being as another, a richer man, a more beautiful woman, or maybe even another species, but me – I am done. Even if I am to get richer or prettier, the basic emotions and the way they make you feel, it is still the same. Happiness is happiness and sadness is sadness, brought about now by different things and experiences, but at the ground level, it is still sadness, and I already know what sadness feels like, and I am not interested at all to feel the same things only over different objects. Jealousy, pride, expectations, contentment, betrayal – all of it, all the contrasting emotions, the hormonal imbalances, I am through with all of them. The only afterlife that might excite me a bit, it’s perhaps the idea of being born as a man in this extremely patriarchal world, experience advantages of the self-proclaimed superiority. Yeah that might excite me a bit. But wait, I can’t take the pain of thirty grams of weight dangling between my legs all my life and to be unable to control the overriding emotions that I don’t even want to feel in the first place but have to anyway and be controlled by them too, solely because of the testosterone running in my body – woah that’s a very painful life. I take it back. Cannot do it, no thank you.\n\nSo, conclusion of the story – you’re lucky Ms Green. Existence is a blessing surely, but life? Not so much. A rational mind on top of it, ooohhh worse! And if things weren’t bad enough, hormones and hippocampus ergo emotions added to them – it’s a torturous curse Ms Green, one that you’re better off without.\n\nLove,\n\nM\n\nPS: “I’m worse at what I do best;\nAnd for this gift, I feel blessed;\nOur little group has always been;\nAnd always will until the end”\n\n“Smells like Teen spirit”, Kurt Cobain\n\nAnd who would have thought that this man, this beautiful piece of a man was so unhappy? That’s actually the point, how can we know.\n",

            "content_text": "Dear Ms Green,\n\nHow are you doing?\n\nI am writing today to talk of Kevin, did I ever mention him to you. \nHe is a new transferee from the most celebrated school of the city. On the first day of our second year, I was thirty minutes early to class, as usual. And normally I am the first person to class, and sit and wait for others to show up, but on this day when I entered, there was this unfamiliar perfectly carved breathing piece of human art sitting in the front row gazing at his phone. His eyes met mine as I moved to my usual spot at the last row of the classroom, and I could swear Ms Green if I had been attached to an ECG machine at that moment, I swear you could have seen me skip a heartbeat, or maybe several. He was so hot, Ms Green, so fucking hot.\n\nNow I am sure he wasn’t in our class because I know all my classmates from first year, so maybe he was in the wrong classroom, or perhaps a transferee, I wasn’t sure at this point but I am not the one to start a conversation so obviously I kept all these questions in my head. Him though, he smiled at me, and after I had sat down, he walked to me, and said “Hey, are you a second year too?” OH MY SWEET FUCKING LORD! His voice was as perfect as his body, and if any of the five senses in my body hadn’t been enamoured with him until this point, they sure were now. Wait, not my skin though, maybe he would offer a handshake? But he didn’t. So just the four other senses then, all full of him. Now I know what you must be thinking, but don’t. I love Heath, of course, with all of my true heart. But can’t we take a minute to appreciate beauty and let it do to you what it’s meant to do to minds? It’s just a crush, Ms Green, a very tempting hot melting chocolate that you would want to dip in kind of crush.\n\nIt has been four months since I laid my eyes on him for the first time, and beside the two lines of conversation we had on the first day of school, we haven’t really talked. We do sometimes “Hi” each other. I don’t want to ruin my crush on him by trying to getting to know him because I know how disappointing reality can be. And from a distance he looks and feels almost perfect, and I wish for him to stay this way.\n\nIts been four months Ms Green, and I havent thought of anyone else but him while I touch myself. Heath doesn’t like it when I do that; he often asks me to let him be near me when I touch myself, sometimes he would ask me if he could just watch, but it’s such a personal moment, he doesn’t understand. Sometimes it’s okay to have him near, but honestly, I don’t like it.\n\nInfidelity is such a strong temptation, and the idea of it arouses me so much. Heath was concerned when I told him this, and I used to think that maybe it was the same for everyone, maybe the excitement of doing something that we weren’t supposed to be doing is a shared excitement among all of us, I strongly used to feel that. But Heath doesn’t, and when I told him about these feelings, he was concerned as if I might actually do something like that to him. But in a decade of our relationship he knows me better. He knows of things I am capable of, and adultery isn’t me. But for my sake, he does sometimes, although with utmost reluctance, agrees to filthy role-plays with me; very occasionally. Such a strong emotion – cheating. Cheating on your partner. I cannot count the number of times I have reached orgasm thinking about cheating on Heath. And for the past four months it’s all been about Kevin.\n\nI love getting off Kevin, because the best part about him is that I do not know him, so in my head he is whatever I want him to be. He is gentle when I want him to be gentle, and he is rough when I want him to be wild. He says the exact words I wish for him to say at the exact moment I wish for him to say them. I have always loved reading erotica rather than watch porn, the act itself doesn’t arouse me as much as the build up does. I do not need to watch or read about what and how does an intercourse happen, I know that very well, thank you. But the situations and the story leading two people to the point where they would actually fuck, that gets me so wet. And words, Ms Green, they are the ultimate seduction, they have always been. Ernest Hemmingway, Li-Young Lee, Eliot, Sylvia Plath, Alina Pleskova - oh my sweet strawberry motherfucking Lord. Said words, written words, words when read – all forms of it, there’s no bigger arousal than whispering the right words to me, I guess.\n\n“The menace of the abyss will be subdued, I say,\nWhen I extort from you the most lovely cries\nAnd quivering whispered pleas\nAnd confused appeals of, Stop, and, More, and Harder.”\n\n  “The Undressing”, Li-Young Lee\n\n\nA mouth that can talk like that, a mind that can make such noises, such mouth shouldn’t stay devoid of sores that only a kiss can bring. And in my head, in bed when it’s dark and there are no disturbances, intense words from unreal mouths of imaginary lovers guide me to bliss.\n\n“But true lovers know, she says, hunger vacant of love is a confusion.”\n\nThere’s nothing that I enjoy more than this moment of privacy, in a pretend world where I can say whatever I want to say and hear whatever it is that I want to hear, and get exactly what I want to get for myself. These small moments to myself, I wouldn’t trade them for anything. Nothing in my existence has felt more intense than how I can make myself feel, except for Heath’s tongue, of course, that’s  a complete different level of ecstasy that cannot pawned for anything,ever.\n\nRegards,\n\nM\n",

            "title": "A Letter to Ms. Green - 2 ",
            "content_text": "Dear Ms Green,\n\nThank you for calling me the other day. Although brief, the last conversation we had over the dead telephone was the most real conversation I have had in a long time.\n\nI hope you’re doing as well as you said you were.\n\nSomething strange happened the other day, I could use the word “abhorrent” but not sure if it would suffice. I haven’t still figured out how to feel about the whole thing. If it was any other day, I would have said that I was angry, disgusted, ashamed, or scared even; but the truth is, my feelings about it are deeper than that. And the exact way I feel about it is still a bit confusing to me.\n\nIt was exactly two days ago, my refrigerator had been empty for weeks and I had been postponing the trip to grocery shopping primarily because of my laziness, but also due to the constant exhaustive state I have lately been in. But I had run out of beer, so the grocery shopping had become indispensable at this point. I would describe to you my clothing and walk to the mall, but have decided that such information is neither necessary nor relevant to what happened next.\n\nOn my walk back to my apartment with both my hands occupied with huge plastic bags I was carrying from the mall, a car with tainted windows slowed down and the door to the back seats opened while parallel to me. Two men sitting with their pants down at their ankles and rubbing their cocks looked directly at my face. I looked at them, then at their hands, then at their cocks, back to their face – too confused to react. Honestly, I was stuck Ms Green, I didn’t know what to do – whether to scream, or swear at them, or run. A few moments passed as the men continued rubbing themselves off. When I realized I was just standing there gawking at their insolent act, I abruptly looked around to suddenly notice how completely empty the street was. I turned towards the path and quickened my pace, almost sprinting to my apartment. The car kept up with me with the back door still open, while the two men sneered with filthy words roaring out of their mouths. I could have told you what they said but I was too scared to take notice of it. I spotted a couple of people at the small vendor a few steps in front of me, and as soon as I saw them, I ran towards them. Apparently the car driver registered their presence too, and he suddenly sped up. But before they left my side, I felt thick goo over my shirt, and my hair.\n\nThe bunch of guys at the vendor must have understood what happened looking at my sweaty and panting appearance, because they offered to walk me to my apartment, and I don’t quite remember what exactly I told them, but I most definitely appreciated the offer more than anything else at the moment.\n\nAt home, in the mirror, I didn’t wish to look at myself. I took three showers that night and several others in the following days, as if the filth brewing within me could be washed off my skin. And I don’t have questions like “why would they do this, or what’s wrong with them,” because some people are just sick, and I know that. Sickness doesn’t need a reason but only a cause, and whatever the cause, it isn’t my concern. My concern, Ms Green, is why am I not able to let this go.\n\nI have been stuck in those few seconds. And despite possessing an extremely weak memory, I can recall each instant vividly, with the colors, the sound, and the smell, O the fucking smell steaming off that car and the semen in my hair, and the shrill of their laughter and the comments “bitch you’re hot” playing over and over again in my head as if something in it is broken, or as if some connection loose and it cannot seem to more further. I have lived that moment more than I have lived any other moment in my life, but I don’t know still how to exactly feel about it.\n\nI obviously am angry, at the people who thought they could just do something like that to anybody, but surprisingly I am angry at myself more. I am angry that I didn’t react, or scream at them, or did not do a fucking thing, but just ran. I am angry at myself for getting stuck. With the way I have grown up, I am angry that I wasn’t prepared for anything like that. And to frustratingly add more, I am angry for feeling ashamed and disgusted at myself.\n\nWhy, Ms Green, do I feel embarrassed when nothing in any of it was my fault or doing. Do I have to be ashamed for being a girl, or worse, do I need to be ashamed for being a “hot bitch”? Why do I feel disgusted for owning skin, and body parts? Why can’t I seem to wash it off me?\n\nWhen an act is done, intentionally or carelessly, for fun or with an intention to offend, planned or in the instant – the trauma and the string of questions that it brings with it afterwards is more haunting than the act itself. Whilst all minds are occupied with the offender and the possibilities of punishments that could justify, could we give perhaps a little more, if not equal, care to talk about the mental state of the victim sometime? Talking about it is a taboo and the general mentality believes than discussing it might further traumatize the offended, but can’t we see that not talking about it makes things worse?\n\nIf everyone would openly discuss and can freely call the wrong out to be wrong, and if we could acknowledge the natural thoughts to be natural, I might not feel so confused then. I would feel okay to be disgusted and angry and scared. I wouldn’t be so confused, and the blame the ones that are to be blamed. And not myself. But we don’t do that.\n\nAnd that’s why, Ms Green, I’d rather be in any other world than this one.\n\nRegards,\n\nM\n",

But before they left my side, I felt thick goo over my shirt, and my hair.</p>\n\n<p>The bunch of guys at the vendor must have understood what happened looking at my sweaty and panting appearance, because they offered to walk me to my apartment, and I don’t quite remember what exactly I told them, but I most definitely appreciated the offer more than anything else at the moment.</p>\n\n<p>At home, in the mirror, I didn’t wish to look at myself. I took three showers that night and several others in the following days, as if the filth brewing within me could be washed off my skin. And I don’t have questions like “why would they do this, or what’s wrong with them,” because some people are just sick, and I know that. Sickness doesn’t need a reason but only a cause, and whatever the cause, it isn’t my concern. My concern, Ms Green, is why am I not able to let this go.</p>\n\n<p>I have been stuck in those few seconds. And despite possessing an extremely weak memory, I can recall each instant vividly, with the colors, the sound, and the smell, O the fucking smell steaming off that car and the semen in my hair, and the shrill of their laughter and the comments “bitch you’re hot” playing over and over again in my head as if something in it is broken, or as if some connection loose and it cannot seem to more further. I have lived that moment more than I have lived any other moment in my life, but I don’t know still how to exactly feel about it.</p>\n\n<p>I obviously am angry, at the people who thought they could just do something like that to anybody, but surprisingly I am angry at myself more. I am angry that I didn’t react, or scream at them, or did not do a fucking thing, but just ran. I am angry at myself for getting stuck. With the way I have grown up, I am angry that I wasn’t prepared for anything like that. And to frustratingly add more, I am angry for feeling ashamed and disgusted at myself.</p>\n\n<p>Why, Ms Green, do I feel embarrassed when nothing in any of it was my fault or doing. Do I have to be ashamed for being a girl, or worse, do I need to be ashamed for being a “hot bitch”? Why do I feel disgusted for owning skin, and body parts? Why can’t I seem to wash it off me?</p>\n\n<p>When an act is done, intentionally or carelessly, for fun or with an intention to offend, planned or in the instant – the trauma and the string of questions that it brings with it afterwards is more haunting than the act itself. Whilst all minds are occupied with the offender and the possibilities of punishments that could justify, could we give perhaps a little more, if not equal, care to talk about the mental state of the victim sometime? Talking about it is a taboo and the general mentality believes than discussing it might further traumatize the offended, but can’t we see that not talking about it makes things worse?</p>\n\n<p>If everyone would openly discuss and can freely call the wrong out to be wrong, and if we could acknowledge the natural thoughts to be natural, I might not feel so confused then. I would feel okay to be disgusted and angry and scared. I wouldn’t be so confused, and the blame the ones that are to be blamed. And not myself. But we don’t do that.</p>\n\n<p>And that’s why, Ms Green, I’d rather be in any other world than this one.</p>\n\n<p>Regards,</p>\n\n<p>M</p>\n",

            "content_text": "Dear Ms Green,\n\nIts been a while since we last spoke.\n\nI would shamelessly confess that I have missed you, although not as much as you would have wanted me to. I apologize for that.\n\nIt has been pretty busy. And sometimes when I get overwhelmed with emotions or situations, I often converse with you in my head, and at many such times I thought of sitting down and writing to you, but time didn’t forgive such moments to me. And now finally when it has, I am glad that it has.\n\nMs Green, how have you been? Have you been able to find answers to the questions we used to be puzzled over. I hope you’ll enlighten me too if any of those quests has been conquered.\n\nAnyway, something strange happened yesterday. I was dead tired, as usual, when the alarm struck, and although everything in my body had been screaming to get up, the will to leave the bed was just not there, and the excuse for an extra five minutes of sleep made me super late, to the point where I had only fifteen minutes at hand to reach the hospital. Taking the bus wasn’t an option, so I got one of those rent bikers to get me to the hospital so I could reach before the attendance for the day was barred.\n\nThe biker was an extremely polite man, in his thirties I guess, and when I told him I was late for duty, he took it too seriously. The zig-zag curves he started on were perhaps the most exciting and dangerous minutes I have experienced in my life. Now, I know that you must be judging my lifestyle based on the aforementioned statement, but Ms Green, I think you already know the kind of dull life I have always had and shall always be in.\n\nAnyways, at one of the sharp turns that he made, our motorbike slid and almost lost balance, and a car running straight at a questionable speed at this early hour of the morning screeched to a sudden halt just inches from my knees. We could have lost balance, I could have fallen on the road, the car could have run over me, the motorbike or the tires of the car could have crushed my skull, they could have run over my legs, I could have been dragged on the road with my legs still stuck to the motorbike with my skin grazing the rough cemented road for miles, or maybe a million other crazily painful things could have happened.\n\nMy head, for the next ten minutes, or thirty, I am not really sure, was in a haze, in the possibility of what could have been. The entire morning, I kept on going back to the incidence, and thinking over and over again, what if I had died.\n\nMs Green, I am not afraid of death. Well, that’s not really correct, I am very much frightened of the idea of death, to suddenly not be one day, to suddenly cease to exist. Especially as a person who doesn’t believe in an afterlife, death does scare me. But when I say I am not afraid, what I actually mean is -  I get it. I accept it. The scary idea of not being able to finish everything, to suddenly disappear, to not be able to finish the whatever Netflix series I might would have started at the time, the idea of it – I accept it.\nBut in the moment, when I was almost there, in a moment what could have been the “it” moment, there was only one thought that scared me.\n\nPeople say that in the last moments of your life, you go through your whole life in a moment. All the memories – true or false ones, lived or imagined ones, all thoughts that were ever born in your head, all of them they cross through you in that one last moment. But the first thing that came to me, dear Ms Green, were words I had kept in my head, hidden, repeated, revised, learnt, but had never said to him. I regret that the most. To have not told him.\n\nAnd I am still here, very much alive, making new memories and living the dull life, with those words repeating/rephrasing in my head every night, and every morning, and every time I see him, and every time I think of him, which is more frequent than any other thought; these words, they have become a living trauma. A wound I have been carrying with me which cannot heal as the only cure is to speak them loudly out to him, which won’t happen. I would not let it.\n\nI know you pity me, Ms Green, and I know that you wish me courage; I wish for it too. But I shall forever keep these words with me, with remorse, dying from them a thousand times. These words are sharp, and I shall forever choose to cut myself and forever bleed than to kill him with them. You know that I cannot say it, Ms Green, you have always known. And I know you wish as much as I do, that I could have.\n\nA dull life with burden of secrets of someone else’s mistakes, such life – I wish for it to conclude soon.\n\nRegards,\n\nM\n",

He wished for a well maintained farm, and reap crops that he had dreamt of - and I nurtured them for him. He was a hard worker and he loved me, and he respected me, and he ruined me in his comprehension of saving me_.\n\nEach seed that fell into me, that I promised a life to, I let him kill- for the sake of faith in my love for him. And he pulled out each root, that he sought unnecessary and a waste, to save life in me. He stood proud at the sight of his beautiful farm before the harvest. His glittering eyes- both proud and thankful- at the sight of the full farm. He had successfully molded me in a way he had always wished to. I was happy for the happiness of my cultivator.\n\nAfter years, a strange seed had fallen into my arms.

I might fall in love with anybody but I would always be me, giving life to the seeds of desires and nurturing them to be a giant tree full of fruits of all of my desires. And my cultivator shall always prioritize his crops more than the wishes of the soil and her nature. The desires of each opposite to the other.\n\nBut something did change this time. I tried and tried but I could not make this seed grow.\n\nI had lost my life, my capability of bearing plants. Years and years of commercial crops and poisonous fertilizers, I had lost my life.\n\nMy cultivator looked at me with a broken heart as I lay barren. Although I was dear to him, we were not compatible anymore. I could not grow his crops anymore.\n\nMy cultivator was a grieving sculptor and I his clay. All this time he was molding me into something he thought he would love, but as the finished sculpture lay before his eyes, the sculptor couldn’t bear the sight of it.\n\nThe fruitless, dead, and unproductive me- crying violently with guilt in my heart. Why could have I not loved the water instead? He would never make me cry. He would not have ruined me. Why could have I not fallen in love with the seed? We cannot live without each other. Why did I fall for my destroyer? And let him, willingly, ruin me, bit by bit, crying over my loss everytime he did and yet let him do it again? Is this what love is?\n",
