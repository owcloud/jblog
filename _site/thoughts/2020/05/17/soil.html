  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I and Him were so wrong for each other, but we could both never understand that.</p>

<p>He wished to mold me into a shape he seemed fit, and I was waiting forever for the day he might just come to like the original me.</p>

<p>I was the soil and he was a cultivator.</p>

<p>He uprooted every every plant that I let grow in me and had found beautiful, and he threw them away. He wished for a well maintained farm, and reap crops that he had dreamt of - and I nurtured them for him. He was a hard worker and he loved me, and he respected me, and he ruined me in his comprehension of saving me_.</p>

<p>Each seed that fell into me, that I promised a life to, I let him kill- for the sake of faith in my love for him. And he pulled out each root, that he sought unnecessary and a waste, to save life in me. He stood proud at the sight of his beautiful farm before the harvest. His glittering eyes- both proud and thankful- at the sight of the full farm. He had successfully molded me in a way he had always wished to. I was happy for the happiness of my cultivator.</p>

<p>After years, a strange seed had fallen into my arms. It was a beautiful seed, I could imagine the pretty young plant sprouting out of it and turning into a majestic tree. And although I did not want to upset my cultivator, yet in the moment I made promises to the seed I was not sure to keep.</p>

<p>I am soil, and this is why I am, I am to provide life to it, this is my nature and this who I am.</p>

<p>And I might love my cultivator as much as I want to, and wish to change myself for him as much as I want to, I cannot change the truth of my nature. I might fall in love with anybody but I would always be me, giving life to the seeds of desires and nurturing them to be a giant tree full of fruits of all of my desires. And my cultivator shall always prioritize his crops more than the wishes of the soil and her nature. The desires of each opposite to the other.</p>

<p>But something did change this time. I tried and tried but I could not make this seed grow.</p>

<p>I had lost my life, my capability of bearing plants. Years and years of commercial crops and poisonous fertilizers, I had lost my life.</p>

<p>My cultivator looked at me with a broken heart as I lay barren. Although I was dear to him, we were not compatible anymore. I could not grow his crops anymore.</p>

<p>My cultivator was a grieving sculptor and I his clay. All this time he was molding me into something he thought he would love, but as the finished sculpture lay before his eyes, the sculptor couldn’t bear the sight of it.</p>

<p>The fruitless, dead, and unproductive me- crying violently with guilt in my heart. Why could have I not loved the water instead? He would never make me cry. He would not have ruined me. Why could have I not fallen in love with the seed? We cannot live without each other. Why did I fall for my destroyer? And let him, willingly, ruin me, bit by bit, crying over my loss everytime he did and yet let him do it again? Is this what love is?</p>
