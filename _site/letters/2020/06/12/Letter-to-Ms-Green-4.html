      Letter To Ms Green 4
    </h1>
  

  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Dear Ms Green,</p>

<p>Have you ever thought of killing yourself?</p>

<p>Ah, I am sorry, I forgot, you can’t really die since you’re not living. Don’t be disheartened Ms Green, life isn’t such a great thing to have anyway, so I can assure you that you’re not missing out on much.</p>

<p>I came across Kurt Cobain’s suicide letter, and was in awe of how simple it was. It made me think of what I might write if ever I had to write one, some day. The last words, wouldn’t you want it to be beautiful or impactful maybe? Rather than simple things that you say every day. But then again, beauty is in simplicity, isn’t it? And when he talks about Freddie, it made think, did he ever even meet Freddie, he must have. But truly though, how much did he know him anyway. To say that he cannot feel what Mercury had felt, and how could he know what Mercury had felt? What if he was faking it too, just like him. My point is, how can you be so certain of what the other person is feeling, and act on it, want it, be envious it?</p>

<p>I look at other people my age, more successful, happier, looking like they have it all figured out and life is such a fun ride. Maybe for some of them it is. But how true is it, and how real? Maybe for some other people, my life might appear that way. But what do they know? Oh, what do they really know, Ms Green.</p>

<p>Life is pain in the ass Ms Green, the problems aren’t as discouraging as the quest to figure it out is; to figure out the purpose of my life I mean. Perhaps if we knew, if I knew, what I was here for and where I am going and what I am doing and the decisions I am making based on what I think I should be doing – is it all even going in the direction I was supposed to be going, or am I making a one-eighty run and am not even aware of it. And it’s scary sometimes, especially because of the religion I was born into, although I do not believe in it but the idea does cross my head sometimes. They say that if things didn’t go right, I would have to born again to correct the mistakes I made in this life. And how foolish is that, like what kind of foolish mission are you sending me to if you won’t even let me know what my mission is in the first place, and then punish me for making mistakes too?</p>

<p>It looks tempting from the outside Ms Green, the idea of being able to feel, and to love, to be satisfied. And one might be interested or excited even at the thought of being as another, a richer man, a more beautiful woman, or maybe even another species, but me – I am done. Even if I am to get richer or prettier, the basic emotions and the way they make you feel, it is still the same. Happiness is happiness and sadness is sadness, brought about now by different things and experiences, but at the ground level, it is still sadness, and I already know what sadness feels like, and I am not interested at all to feel the same things only over different objects. Jealousy, pride, expectations, contentment, betrayal – all of it, all the contrasting emotions, the hormonal imbalances, I am through with all of them. The only afterlife that might excite me a bit, it’s perhaps the idea of being born as a man in this extremely patriarchal world, experience advantages of the self-proclaimed superiority. Yeah that might excite me a bit. But wait, I can’t take the pain of thirty grams of weight dangling between my legs all my life and to be unable to control the overriding emotions that I don’t even want to feel in the first place but have to anyway and be controlled by them too, solely because of the testosterone running in my body – woah that’s a very painful life. I take it back. Cannot do it, no thank you.</p>

<p>So, conclusion of the story – you’re lucky Ms Green. Existence is a blessing surely, but life? Not so much. A rational mind on top of it, ooohhh worse! And if things weren’t bad enough, hormones and hippocampus ergo emotions added to them – it’s a torturous curse Ms Green, one that you’re better off without.</p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>M</p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> <em>“I’m worse at what I do best;
And for this gift, I feel blessed;
Our little group has always been;
And always will until the end”</em></p>

<p>“Smells like Teen spirit”, Kurt Cobain</p>

<p>And who would have thought that this man, this beautiful piece of a man was so unhappy? That’s actually the point, how can we know.</p>
